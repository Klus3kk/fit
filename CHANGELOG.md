## Why This Major Restructuring?

When I started developing FIT framework I wanted it to be as an educational project to understand deep learning from first principles. But after some initial development, I was coming up with more and more ideas, so tgat the project would be useful for the public usage:

1. **Scale Beyond Educational Use**: Transform from a learning project into a production-ready framework
2. **Meet Professional Standards**: Align with industry best practices for ML frameworks
3. **Ensure Long-term Viability**: Build a sustainable project architecture

### Complete Project Restructuring

#### **Previous Issues**
- **Flat Structure**: Mixed organization with some modules in root, others scattered
- **Unclear Imports**: Inconsistent import paths (`from train.optim import Adam` vs `from nn.linear import Linear`)
- **Limited Testing**: Basic test coverage without proper organization
- **No CI/CD**: Manual testing and deployment
- **Minimal Documentation**: Lack of comprehensive docs and examples
- **Code Quality**: Inconsistent style, missing type hints, print-based debugging

### Added

#### **Core Improvements**
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Custom exceptions for better error handling
  - `TensorError`, `ShapeError`, `AutogradError` for specific error types
  - Detailed error messages with context
- **Logging System**: Professional logging replacing print statements
  - Colored console output
  - File logging support
  - Performance tracking
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration system
  - YAML config support
  - Environment variable integration
  - Validation and type checking
- **Type Annotations**: Full type hints throughout the codebase
- **Memory Management**: Tensor caching and memory profiling

#### **Development Infrastructure**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing
  - Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
  - Multiple Python versions (3.8-3.11)
  - Automated benchmarking
  - Coverage reporting
- **Code Quality Tools**:
  - Pre-commit hooks (black, isort, flake8, mypy)
  - Automated code formatting
  - Style consistency enforcement
- **Documentation System**:
  - Sphinx-based API documentation
  - Tutorials and guides
  - Example gallery

#### **New Features**
- **Enhanced Optimizers**:
  - SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization) with adaptive mode
  - Lion optimizer with memory efficiency
  - Learning rate schedulers
- **Advanced Layers**:
  - Spectral Normalization
  - Neural ODEs with multiple solvers
  - Attention mechanisms (planned)
- **Improved Data Pipeline**:
  - Better DataLoader with sampling strategies
  - Transform pipeline
  - Memory-efficient data handling

### Changed

#### **Module Organization**
- **Before**: `from train.optim import Adam`
- **After**: `from fit.optim.adam import Adam`
- Clear separation between stable and experimental features
- Consistent import paths

#### **API Improvements**
- Tensor operations now support method chaining
- Consistent parameter names across modules
- Better default values based on best practices

#### **Error Messages**
- **Before**: `ValueError: shapes not aligned`
- **After**: `ShapeError: Cannot multiply tensors with shapes (2, 3) and (4, 5). Expected shapes to be compatible for matrix multiplication.`

### Fixed
- Memory leaks in autograd graph
- Numerical instability in softmax computation
- Broadcasting issues in tensor operations
- Gradient accumulation bugs
- Thread safety issues in data loading

### Testing
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for common workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Gradient checking tests

### Breaking Changes
- Import paths have changed 
- Some internal APIs renamed for consistency
- Removed deprecated functions
- Default dtype changed from float64 to float32

### Future Plans
- GPU support via CuPy 
- Distributed training 
- JIT compilation 
- Model deployment utilities
