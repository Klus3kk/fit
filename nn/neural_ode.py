"""
Implementation of Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) layers.

Neural ODEs represent a novel class of models where the output is computed
by solving an ODE, replacing traditional discrete layer-to-layer transformations
with continuous dynamics. This makes them particularly suitable for time series,
physical systems, and data with continuous underlying structures.
